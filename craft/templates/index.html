{#
 # Homepage template
 # ---------------
 #
 # When this template gets loaded, it will be because someone has accessed
 # http://yoursite.com/ (without any URI). Craft checks to see if you have
 # a Single section set to be the Homepage (as you do, by default), and
 # loads the section’s Template (this file). A special ‘entry’ variable
 # will already be set for you, assigned to the Homepage entry.
 #
 # It's worth noting that even if you didn't have a Homepage Single section,
 # as long as this template remains at craft/templates/index.html, it
 # would still be the one to get loaded when accessing http://yoursite.com/,
 # albeit without an ‘entry’ variable already set for you.
 #
 # See this page for more details on how Craft routes requests:

          <h3>Startups/Solopreneurs</h3>

          <p class="padded-bottom">First impressions are critical so your interface should look amazing, your reputation depends on it. A clean, modern and intuitive interface will create trust and make an immediate impact to your new business. Don’t sell your amazing idea short with a lacklustre and boring design.</p>

          <h3>Developers</h3>

          <p>Even with a skill list as long as your arm, you’re never guaranteed clients will pick you over the 1000’s of other devs out there. Adding a clean, modern and intuitive interface to your well-coded app or website makes all the difference. Get both right and you’ll land better, higher paying projects.</p>
